# Enochian Chess for Zillions of Games (Abandoned)
An attempt to write a ruleset for Enochian Chess for use in [Zillions of Games](https://www.zillions-of-games.com/), adapted from the ruleset presented in the book _Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn: A Four-Handed Chess Game_ by Chris Zalewski.

## Notes on the Development
This attempt has been abandoned because in a lot of ways, Zillions seems to struggle with various aspects (such as having two pieces on one square, as happens with the Kings), and I'm a bit over my head with this because it's an old, fairly obscure language with little available documentation. As such, I will be moving forward with attempting this in Ludii (eventually, no actual idea when), which I'd been planning to convert this game into afterwards anyway. You're probably wondering why I even bothered with Zillions in the first place, and it's because... I thought it'd be cool to do it in both programs, as Zillions is still used by at least some people. I'm just keeping it up as-is in the event that someone finds something about the code I've written or the graphics I made useful for some reason or other.

## Notes on the Graphics
Per Regardie (as cited in Zalewski, 1994, p. 21), the boards are done with just the pyramid colour scheme, and none of the other symbology, along with "a white border [...] to contain the forces therein". This choice was primarily for the sake of simplicity of visual design. White spacing was also left between the various markings in order to enhance redability of the board.

The simple board is coloured as per the instructions by Zalewski (1994, pp. 30-31).

Colouration of pieces has been simplified to simply their element, to prevent confusion during play. The pawn is the exception, as the colour of the head indicates the piece it'll promote to.
