# Enochian Chess
A ruleset for Enochian Chess for use in Zillions of Games, adapted from the ruleset present in _Enochian Chess of the Golden Dawn: A Four-Handed Chess Game_ by Chris Zalewski.

## Notes on the Graphics
Per Regardie (as cited in Zalewski, 1994, p. 21), the boards are done with just the pyramid colour scheme, and none of the other symbology, along with "a white border [...] to contain the forces therein". This choice was primarily for the sake of simplicity of visual design. White spacing was also left between the various markings in order to enhance redability of the board.

The simple board is coloured as per the instructions by Zalewski (1994, pp. 30-31).

Colouration of pieces has been simplified to simply their element, to prevent confusion during play. The pawn is the exception, as the colour of the head indicates the piece it'll promote to.
